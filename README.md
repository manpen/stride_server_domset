# STRIDE
This is the source code repository for the [STRIDE website](https://domset.algorithm.engineering).

The STRIDE system is designed as an *unofficial* companion to the [PACE 2025 Dominating Set challenge](https://pacechallenge.org/2025/ds/).
It provides a [large database of problem instances](https://domset.algorithm.engineering) and solutions.
We hope that this will help to produce more general solvers that have fewer bugs.
